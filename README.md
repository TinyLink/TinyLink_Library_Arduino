# TinyLink Library for Arduino Uno

[TinyLink](http://tinylink.emnets.org/view/en/index.html) is a holistic system for rapid development of IoT applications. It adopts a top-down approach, which greatly accelerates the developing process.

This repository contains the tinylink library for Arduino Uno.

## Features

- Top-down. Developer uploads his TinyLink code to webIDE, then TinyLink will generate hardware configurations with considering all kinds of hardware constraints.
- Rapid. All an IoT developer had to do are writing TinyLink code and connecting devices according to hardware connection graph (Generated by TinyLink system), which accelerates the developing process.
- Automatic. TinyLink will provide hardware configurations when a developer uploads his TinyLink code to the system.
- Hardware Independent. TinyLink system will generate the cheapest harware configuration according to TinyLink code, the generatered hardware platform is uncertain and can meet all the needs of the developer.

## Examples

- [led blink](https://github.com/TinyLink/TinyLink_Library_Arduino/blob/master/examples/tl_led.cpp) - Demonstrates how to use tinylink library to implement led blink.
- [get temperature and humidity](https://github.com/TinyLink/TinyLink_Library_Arduino/blob/master/examples/tl_temp_humi.cpp) - Demonstrates how to use tinylink library to get temperature and humidity.
- [TinyLink MQTT](https://github.com/TinyLink/TinyLink_Library_Arduino/blob/master/examples/tl_mqtt.cpp) - Demonstrates how to use tinylink mqtt to connect to alibaba IoT Studio.
